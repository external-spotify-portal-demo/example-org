# Queue Proxy

## Overview

The **Queue Proxy** is a lightweight service designed to act as an intermediary between clients and the main queueing system. It provides a seamless interface for managing task queues, ensuring resilience, scalability, and better performance for distributed systems. By abstracting away the complexities of direct interaction with the queue, it simplifies integration and enhances developer productivity.

Key features:

- Proxy layer for queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, etc.)
- Retry mechanisms for failed tasks
- Configurable rate limiting
- Detailed logging and monitoring support

Whether you're building a microservices architecture or scaling a monolithic application, the Queue Proxy ensures reliable task queuing for your application needs.
